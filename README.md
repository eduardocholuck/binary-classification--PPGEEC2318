## Overview

This project aims to predict admission outcomes based on features such as GPA, GMAT score, work experience and others. The model was developed for the ***Project #01 for PPGEEC2318 - Machine Learning.***

## Model

- **Model Type**: Binary classifier  
- **Framework**: PyTorch  
- **Architecture**: Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)  
- **Loss Function**: Binary Cross Entropy  
- **Optimizer**: Adam  
- **Validation Strategy**: Training/validation split using `train_test_split`

## Technologies Used

- Python
- PyTorch
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Dataset

- **Original Source**: The original dataset was obtained from the following repository: [KatePril/admission-prediction](https://github.com/KatePril/admission-prediction/tree/main/dataset). 
- **Original Size**: 6,194 entries  
- **Original Features**:
  - `application_id`, `gender`, `international`, `gpa`, `major`, `race`, `gmat`, `work_exp`, `work_industry`, `admission`

### Feature Engineering and Cleaning

The following preprocessing steps were applied to prepare the dataset for model training:

- **Admission Label**:
  - Merged `Waitlist` and `Admit` as a single positive class.
  - Encoded `admission` as binary: `Admit/Waitlist` â†’ `1`, others â†’ `0`.

- **Missing Values**:
  - Replaced missing values in the `race` column with `'Unknown'`.

- **Categorical Encoding**:
  - `race`: Mapped to integers from 0 to 5 (e.g., `Other`: 0, `White`: 4, `Unknown`: 5).
  - `gender`: Encoded as `0` (Male) and `1` (Female).
  - `work_industry`: Mapped to integers from 0 to 13 based on category (e.g., `CPG`: 0, `Technology`: 13).

- **Class Balancing**:
  - Performed *under-sampling* of the majority class (`admission == 0`) to match the number of positive samples, resulting in a balanced dataset.

- **Final Size**: 2000 samples after class balancing.


## Training

The model was trained using a simple neural network built with PyTorch. The main training steps include:

- **Architecture**: A fully connected feedforward neural network (Multilayer Perceptron).
- **Input Features**: Normalized versions of `gpa`, `gmat`, `work_exp`, and encoded categorical variables.
- **Loss Function**: Binary Cross Entropy Loss (`nn.BCELoss`)
- **Optimizer**: Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001
- **Batch Size**: 16
- **Epochs**: 200
- **Validation Strategy**: 80/20 train-validation split using `train_test_split`

During training, loss values were monitored across epochs for traing and validation, as you can see below and a confusion matrix was computed to evaluate model performance.

## Evaluation Metrics

| Metric     | Value   |
|------------|---------|
| Accuracy   | 0.7575  |
| Precision  | 0.7452  |
| Recall     | 0.7789  |
| F1-Score   | 0.7617  |


* The model achieves 75.8% accuracy, indicating solid overall performance on predicting MBA admissions.

* With a recall of 77.9%, it effectively identifies most admitted candidates, minimizing false negatives.

* A precision of 74.5% and F1-score of 76.2% reflect a good balance between correctness and completeness in its positive predictions.

## Model Saving

The trained model is saved in `.pth` format using:

```python
torch.save(model.state_dict(), "mba_model.pth")
```

## Final Remarks

This model is a proof of concept developed for academic purposes. Although it shows promising results, it is not recommended for production use without further generalization and fairness assessments.
